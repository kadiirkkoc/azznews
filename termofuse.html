                                and sharing of insights into subject matter covered by the coursework of a broad continuum of educational institutions and formats. AzzNews strongly believes that online peer-to-peer discussion can serve as a crucial supplement
                                to classroom instructional experience. AzzNews is not endorsed by any educational institution, association of educators, or textbook author or publisher. Rather, it is an independent forum for speech and scholarship by
                                and for students, and all content should be attributed solely to AzzNews and its community of users and contributors. To the extent that any parts of AzzNews’s Web Site reference any textbook or source material, it is for
                                the purpose of discussion and accurate attribution only and is not meant to imply any connection to or affiliation with the authors or publishers of those materials, or to replace or serve as a substitute for classroom
                                instruction or the need to purchase such textbooks or source material. To the contrary, whenever possible, AzzNews provides users with direct access to links where users can obtain copies of textbooks or other source material.
                                AzzNews serves as a laboratory for innovation and strives to offer Services that create new outlets for students’ creative expression and tools that aid in the educational process by allowing users to ask questions of one
