                                        a meeting at the Turkish presidential palace ignited a public uproar.</p>

                                        room for discussions with Erdogan, but only two chairs had been set out in front of the EU and Turkish flags for the three leaders. </p>

                                    <p> The incident came only weeks after Erdogan pulled Turkey out of a key European convention aimed at combatting violence against women. The move was a blow to Turkey’s women’s rights movement, which says domestic violence
                                        and murders of women are on the rise. During her visit to Ankara, von der Leyen called for Erdogan to reverse his decision to withdraw from the Istanbul Convention — named after the Turkish city where it was signed
                                        in 2011.</p>

                                        He's made it his business to introduce fascinated visitors to every facet of Cappadocian culture, especially Derinkuyu.</p>

                                    <p>"Picture this," he says standing in what was once an underground stable. "People are farming outside and then when an army attacks these people take all of their animals and come inside." <br> Omer explains that as
                                        many as 20,000 people would have hidden in these narrow passages for months at a time when Mongol forces roamed overhead. They would have made use of hundreds of store rooms, living spaces and even communication
                                        tunnels through which they could shout messages and relay news of what was happening above ground. <br> Today, Omer runs the Museum Hotel. Painstakingly restored over two decades, this opulent property is home to
                                        60 caves and 10 incredible buildings, some dating back a thousand years. Omer's work to bring the ruins back to life means that tourists can now stay in this historic spot, tucked below Uçhisar Castle, the highest

                                        birds around and they come and say welcome to you," pointing to a pair of amorous peacocks. <br> What this amazing hotel, and these ancient cave cities show is how the landscape has shaped the people of Cappadocia
                                        and how they too have shaped it back over the past millennia.</p>

                                        has no windows, the lack of light has meant its exquisite frescoes have been fully preserved. The colorful renderings of Christ on the cross and the betrayal by Judas date from the 11th century. Just as at Derinkuyu,
                                        it pays to expect the unexpected.</p>

                                        is another example of nature working together with the local people to help create something beautiful. This river and the mud it produces has provided generations of craftsmen with a distinctive red clay that's

                                        regain ownership of her work. She described the sale to Braun as her “worst-case scenario”, accusing him of bullying her in his role as former manager of Kanye West and manager to Justin Bieber.</p>

                                        reportedly gave her the opportunity to “earn” back one old album for every new one she recorded before he sold the label to Braun. Swift said discussions with Braun about buying her catalogue from him were stymied
                                        when his team asked her to sign a non-disclosure agreement that would also prevent her from speaking negatively about him in public.</p>

                                    <p>Swift has implied that Braun remains involved with Shamrock’s ownership of her music. Re-recording her albums devalues their investment. As songwriter, she can deny the use of old material in sync requests for media
                                        including film, television and advertisements.</p>
